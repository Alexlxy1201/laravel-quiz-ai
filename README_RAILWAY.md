1. Go to [https://railway.app](https://railway.app) and sign in with GitHub.
2. Click **New Project ‚Üí Deploy from GitHub repo**.
3. Choose your Laravel repo.
4. Wait until Railway builds automatically (it will detect PHP via `composer.json`).

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Set Environment Variables
In Railway‚Äôs ‚ÄúVariables‚Äù tab, add:

| Key | Example Value |
|-----|----------------|

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Notes
- `Procfile` tells Railway how to start Laravel using the internal PHP server.
- `railway.json` defines build and run steps (composer install, serve).
- No database is needed ‚Äî this is a stateless student-side app.

If you need to re-deploy after edits:
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "update"
git push
```

Railway will rebuild automatically.
