# ðŸ“¸ AI Quiz Solver (Laravel â€“ Student Only)

A minimal **English UI** web page for students to upload or take a photo of a question and get **instant AI answers** (no storage, no teacher panel). Uses **OpenAI Vision** (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`).

## ðŸ“¦ What is this?
This is a **drop-in feature pack** for a Laravel 10/11 project.

## ðŸ›  How to use
1. Create a fresh Laravel project (or use an existing one):
   ```bash
   composer create-project laravel/laravel laravel-quiz-ai
   cd laravel-quiz-ai
   ```
2. Copy the contents of this zip **into your Laravel root**, merging folders (`app/`, `routes/`, `resources/`, `public/`).
3. Install dependencies and run dev server:
   ```bash
   composer install
   php artisan key:generate
   php artisan serve
   ```
4. Configure `.env`:
   ```ini
   OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx
   OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini
   OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1
   MOCK=false
   ```
5. Open: `http://localhost:8000`

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Railway
- Push your Laravel repo to GitHub
- Create a Railway project and connect the repo
- Set environment variables in Railway:
  - `APP_KEY` (use `php artisan key:generate --show` locally)
  - `APP_ENV=production`
  - `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-xxxx`
  - `OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini`
  - `OPENAI_BASE_URL=https://api.openai.com/v1`

- Max upload size is 10MB (configurable in `SolveController`).

## âœ… Endpoints
